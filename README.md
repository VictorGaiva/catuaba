# Phoenix-Channels

## Description
A Typescript Client for connecting and interacting with Elixir's [Phoenix-Channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html), using [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview)'s API.

## Motivation
Typescript is becoming a _de facto_ standard for Front-end Development, being already adopted or  supported by most of Javascript Front-end Frameworks. This project aims help quickstart the creation of a set of tools that interact with the Elixir ecosystem using modern and robust tools, while also providing extensibility maintainability.
